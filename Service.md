# SKG-IF Service Extension

A Service is a type of software application or component that provides specific 
functionality or operations over a network, often via the internet, and is typically accessed 
through an interface such as an API or a web application.
(note: Service is renaming of Software Service, which is still used in many OSTrails discussion documents)



## Properties

The properties set was suggested and informed from a number of examples both thematic and general:
- The different CMDI schema for tools & services used in the [VLO catalogue], esp the [UDPipe example] 
- [SSHOMP catalogue] (tools and services) different examples
- [ELG catalogue] (tools and services) different examples
- [CLARIN LR Switchboard schema]
- The [Schema.org SoftwareApplication] type has many useful properties 
- The [EOSC Service Profile 4.1 rc (latest) and 5.0]



### `local_identifier`
*String* (mandatory): Unique code identifying a [Software Service] in the SKG (if any, otherwise "stateless identifier").

{: .highlight }
**Suggestion:** Use a URL as a string to make this entity dereferenceable on the Web. For additional information, see the [section 'Local identifiers of entities' of the Interoperability Framework](/interoperability-framework/#local-identifiers-of-entities). A local_identifier can also be (derived) from an existing persistent identifier.

```json
    "local_identifier": "11234/1-4816"
```

### `identifiers`
*List* (recommended): Objects representing external identifiers for the entity. 

Each identifier is structured as follows:
- `scheme` *String* (mandatory): The scheme for the external identifier.
- `value` *String* (mandatory): The external identifier.

**Note:** the current version of SKG-IF includes the following types of identifiers (to be specified as strings in the field “scheme”): `doi`, `handle`, `pmid`, `url`, `omid`, ...

```json
    "identifiers": [
        {
            "scheme": "handle",
            "value": "11234/1-4816"
        },
        {
            "scheme": "doi",
            "value": "10.18653/v1/K18-2020"
        }
    ]
```

### `entity_type`

Needed for parsing purposes; fixed to `service`.

```json
    "entity_type": "service"
```

### `name`
*Object* (optional): The names of a [Software service] (multiple for multilingualism). 

The object is a dictionary, the keys represent language codes following [ISO 639-1]; the special key `none` is reserved whenever the information about the language is not available or cannot be shared.

```json
    "name": {
        "en": "UDPipe",

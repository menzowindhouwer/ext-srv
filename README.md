# SKG-IF Service extension

The extension proposal and work comes from the OSTrails project

Brief motivation:

To make the SKG-IF better fit with the research infrastructures landscape it should also provide a Software Service entity that models the many operational software services created and operated by the RIs and RPOs.
A Service is a type of software application or component that provides specific functionality or operations over a network, often via the internet, and is typically accessed through an interface such as an API or a web application. This initiative is initially pushed by examples from SSHOC and ESCAPE communities working in the OSTrails project.
